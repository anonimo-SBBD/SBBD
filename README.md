This repository has the codes used during the production of the paper for Suicide Rates

For this work, we separated the codes in notebooks according to the data mining for suicide deaths, suicide attempts, and healthcare infrastructure.

The notebooks are for downloading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning.

We added some extra information about the preprocessing analysis, such as the data dictionaries for SINAN and CNES datasets, the form for SINAN (violence form), and the types of healthcare facilities.
